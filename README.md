# Violence-Recognition-in-Live-Surveillance-using-Deep-Learning
Will creating a good data set with activity labels of individual and mob as walking, fighting, dancing, etc. and try of estimating human skeleton poses and recognize actions of violence using Deep Neural Networks.

I have taken this as my MTech major research work - if successful then findings will be:
1. A good quality data set with active classification labels.
2. A new method to detect voilence or improved accuracy in prev. models.
